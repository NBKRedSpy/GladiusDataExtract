# Issues
## Termagant
Attacks are not showing x10
Accuracy is not shown.


# Todo

- [x] Move the calculation logic to the entities from the UI.
- [ ] Consolidate strengthDamage, meleeDamage, rangeDamage to one item.
- [ ] Add the remaining unit base values to the display
- [ ] Add the icons for the values to the display (gear for production, bio icon, etc.)


- [ ] Load the trait objects.
- [ ] Apply traits to weapons.  
    * *Warning* some traits are based on something being unlocked. See [Trait View Options](#trait-view-options)
	
        * figure out how to handle that for view.
	Example:  Hive Tyrant smash and rending
	Might do anything that does have a trait/modifiers/modifier/conditions for now.  Really only care about the weapons.

	I think there are some conditional trait applications as well.


# Next Backlog features
- [ ] Add item compare

# Remaing Backlog
- [ ] Add display for premutation of traits 


## Trait view options
Maybe display a weapon for each permutation for traits?  Not sure on that.

Might be easier if they are inline?

Ultimately a javascript filter would be best.


# Features
* Add item compare
