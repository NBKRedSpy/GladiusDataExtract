# Todo

* Move the calculation logic to the entities from the UI.

* Load the trait objects.
* Apply traits to weapons.  
    * *Warning* some traits are based on something being unlocked. See [Trait View Options](#trait-view-options)
	
        * figure out how to handle that for view.
	Example:  Hive Tyrant smash and rending
	Might do anything that does have a trait/modifiers/modifier/conditions for now.  Really only care about the weapons.

	I think there are some conditional trait applications as well.

* Probably consolidate the melee and range attacks to a single display text.

## Later tasks
Update to import all of the .xml data.


# Trait view options
Maybe display a weapon for each permutation for traits?  Not sure on that.

Might be easier if they are inline?

Ultimately a javascript filter would be best.
