# Todo

* Move the calculation logic to the entities from the UI.

* Load and add the traits
* Apply traits to weapons.  
	Example:  Hive Tyrant smash and rending
	Might do anything that does have a trait/modifiers/modifier/conditions for now.  Really only care about the weapons.

	I think there are some conditional trait applications as well.

* Probably consolidate the melee and range attacks to a single display text.
